I want to get a landing page like docs.antora.org and https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/ that have

arrow	Churches
	Immanual with default overview/history
          arrow Founders      just like krueckeberg.gitlab.io/krueckeberg now looks
	Friedheim with default overview/history
          either the link to familysearch digital document of [Zion Lutheran Church, Friedheim](https://www.familysearch.org/library/books/records/item/212203-adams-county-indiana-zion-evangelical-lutheran-church-friedheim-record-book-1883-1888) Friedheim or something
