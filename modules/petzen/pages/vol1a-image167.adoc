= 1744 Johann Heinrich Krückeberg Baptized

The baptism of a Johann Heinrich Krückeberg son occurred 19 January 1744. His given names are not entirely known. The word preceding Johann is badly faded and not
discernable. Nor is the original hard writing sharp. Many arcane abbreviations of ending syllables are used. All this makes it hard to be confident in the trans-
literation.

[NOTE]
.The word before Johann Heinrich?
Due to the poor quality of the text, it is not evident what word precedes "Johann Heinrich". Is it the first of threes given +
names? By comparing the word patterns of many entries of this early time period, one can make
an educated guess. It is likely the "benahmsen". "benahmsen" itself is likely just another form of benamsen, colloquial
for benennen, meaning "to name".

.The first three entries for January 1744 were ommitted.
