.Krückeberg Surname Puzzle

[IMPORTANT] 
====
In this entry for the death of Friederich Wilhelm, the **Krückeberg** surname appears twice:

* It first appears above the underlined surname of the deceased child: Friderich Wilhem Croemer.
* In the second instance, **Krückeberg** is written above the surname of the father, Johann Heinrich Cromer.

What is the intention or meaning?

No other death entry up to this has contained a second surname. The entry gives his father as a Croemer(Crömer/Krömer). Did Friderich Wilhelm
Croemer die in a Krückeberg family but was recorded with his biological parents? Is there the remote possibilty his father was a Krückeberg,
but he got recorded with the "wrong" father (or mother)?

To answer these questions would require researching the Cromer parents mentioned in this entry, looking for any previous marriages. All Krückeberg
entries that name as child named Friederich/Friedrich Wilhelm also need to be noted.

Someone who might have help answer this two-surname puzzle would be an archivists in the Niedersächisches Landarchiv (Lower Saxony State Archives).
Emailing this question to the the Niedersächisches Landarchiv would be worthwhile.

But for now, the plan is finish recording the rest of the church registers Krückeberg entries and revisit this question later.

[NOTE]
.Comments
====
In the image the surname [.underline]#Croemer# is underlined, denoting the deceased. Why the surname **Kruckeberg** (appended with a colon the first
time) also appears is unclear?

Also the month of May is written in entry 14 and applies to entreis 15 and 16.
