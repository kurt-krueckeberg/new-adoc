We know from this tyepwritten document 

image::Familienschein-des-Auswanderers.jpg[align=left,width=1600,title='Familienschein des Auswanderers',xref=image$Familienschein-des-Auswanderers.jpg]

that the Krückeberg family originated from an area near Petzen called Berenbushch. This document originated from Harry Frederick Krueckeberg who said
(as I recall) that it was among his father's papers, and he believed his father had typed it. I obtained the copy above from Melvin Krueckeberg several
years ago.

According to "The Union Township Krueckebergs (Krückeberg) From Germany to Adams County, Indiana, 1850 to June 29, 2008", by Melvin E. W. Krueckeberg,
a spiral bound publication distributed at the 2008 Krueckeberg reunion in Adams county:

.From _The Union Township Krueckebergs (Krückeberg) From Germany to Adams County, Indiana, 1850 to June 29, 2008_
[quote, Melvin E. W. Krueckeberg]   
When I began doing research on the Krueckebergs I had no idea where they lived in Germany.
In 1999 Arlene and I were passing through Colorado and we stopped to say hello to cousin
Harry in Fort Collins. I told him about my new hobby an[sic] that I did not know where in
Germany the Kruekebergs were located. Harry said: I have that information and gave me as[sic]
copy of the Certificate of the Emigrant...
 
Ernest Thode's _German-English Genealogical Dictionary_, defines **Familenschein** as **family records**. "Familienschein des Auswanderers"
thus translates as: **Emigrant's Family Records**.

At the bottom of the document is the name of an "official" of some sort, who is "von Bergkirchen" "from Bergkirchen". Bergkirchen is 
22 miles distant from Petzen.

The original document (or a digital copy of it) may be available, but more leg work is needed.

Too much longer after arriving period, because his name does not appear. On the land deeds. 

In the years. 

Fill this in instead of that of his wife. 

Who wrote with an x. And her son the eldest appear. We know that the family was not the original purchases of the land from the Land office. 

And they were the second. 

Owners of the land period, the pets in. Church records are now on our Kion. And this will allow us. 

To figure fill in. The vital records of burst marriages and deaths and help for their trace. Family, tree period.
