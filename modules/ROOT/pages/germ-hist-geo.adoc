== Why Jurisdictions are Important

A jurisdiction is an entity, corresponding to a specific geographical area, that creates and maintains records.
Different jurisdictions maintained different types of records at different times.

Identifying jurisdictional changes helps locate what records were created for a place for which time periods, and where those
records are found.
