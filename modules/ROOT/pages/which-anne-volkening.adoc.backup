= Which Anne Maragarethe

**TODO:** Polish later.

On 22 February 1793 Anne Margarethe Volkening married Volkening Married Christian Fridrich, the father of Carl Fridrich and Johann Heinrich Philip 
Bleeke. Since there are five prospective **Anne Marg.**'s listed in the birth index of the Frille "Verzeichnis der Getaufte, Getraute und Gestorbene,
1758-1804", which is the correct **Anne Margarethe Volkening**?

== Backgound and Evidence:
 
The xref:frille:vol2-image202-53.adoc[marriage record] for Anne Margarethe Volkening and Christian Fridrich Bleeke shows they married on **22 February 1793**.
It states that the bride was

  aus Leteln (from Leteln)

We also know the birth of their first son, Carl Fridrich, occurred the following year, in 1794, and their next child, Johann Heinrich Philip, was born in 1797.
Links to their birth records are below:

* xref:frille:vol2-image123.adoc[Carl Fridrich Bleeke] baptized on 2^nd^ November 1794, likely born 30^th^ October
* xref:frille:vol2-image136.adoc[Johann Heinrich Philipp Bleeke] baptized on 5^td^ November 1779, likely born 3^rd^ November

As adults these sons were the first of the children to emigrate to the U.S., and in December 1840, while residing in Hamiliton county, Ohio, each was 
awarded land patents by the U.S. Land Office in Fort Wayne to tracts of land in Union township, Adams, Indiana.

.Kirchspiel defined
_Kirchspiel_ is the term that describes the _Ortschaften_, the surrounding villages, that belong to a particular nearby parish (Gemeinde).

=== Five Prospective Candidates

Approximately 70 Volkening births are listed in the birth index, and of these, three girls have *"Anne (Anna)** and the abbreviation of **Marg.** as given names.
Two have the name-pair "Anne Marg.":

=== Summary of All Findings

None of the first three candidates were born in Leteln. Two of these were names **Anne tragically died about age three. Of the two remaining and youngest candidates, only Anne Margarethe
Volkening, age 22, was from **Leteln** as the marriage record xref:frille:vol2-image202-53.adoc[marriage record] states for the bride's place of residence.

|===

We know that **Cath. Ilse Marg. Volkening** married to **Carl Friederichf Bals** because the birth of one of her children happened to be the first birth of 1794.
This was serendipitously discovered when determining the birth year of **Carl Fridrich Bleeke**, the first child of the Anne Margarethe Volkening who
married Christian Fridrich Bleek on 22 February 1793:

image::frille:vol2-img121-225.jpg[title="1st birth of 1794 is a child of Anna Cath. Ilse. Marg. Volkening(Click to englarge)",xref=frille:image$vol2-img121-225.jpg]

We presently don't know the birth date of Christian Fridrich Bleeke. No Christian Fridrich Bleeke birth
is listed in the birth index for the years 1758 to 1804. Thus, either he was much older around age 35 (or older) and his birth is
recorded in the prior volume (which unfortunately has no indexes, requiring page-by-page examination), or his birth was recorded in a
different church's Kirchbuch.

If he was much older around age 35 or older, then we are forced to consider whether he might have married an older yet-undiscovered Anne
Margarethe whose birth is listed in the 1664-1757 Frille Kirchbuch. We have seen that of the first three candidates, one tragically died aournd age three, the other
two were not born in Leteln, and one of these married Carl Friederich Bals.`

It is, though, more likely than not that Anne Margarethe Volkening, born 24 May 1770, is the correct bride. A certain conclusion depends on knowing more about the groom's age
But the wife of Christian Fridrich Bleeke was 22, which we take as the most likely age among of a first marriage.

We wish we hard, reliable, documented sources for individuals in Jürgen's link:https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/62546951/family?cfpid=32091459556[Bleeke Family Tree]
but we this analysis shows Anne Margerethe Volkening born is the prefered bride of Christian Fridrich Bleeke.
