= Anne Margarethe nee Volkening Bleeke

On 22 February 1793 Christian Fridrich Bleeke married Anne Margarthe Volkenina. Three of their sons would later emigrate from Schaumburg-Lippe
and settile in Adams county.

Who was the Anne Margarthe Volkening that married Christian Fridrich Bleeke on 24 May 1770 in the Frille church? There were several Anne Margareth
Volkenings in the Frille parish.  Which one married Christian Bleeke?

As explained below, the mostly likely candidate was born 24 May 1770, in Leteln.

== Introduction

On 22 February 1793 Anne Margarethe Volkening Volkening married Christian Fridrich, the father of Carl Fridrich and Johann Heinrich Philip 
Bleeke. Since there are five **Anne Marg.**'s listed in the birth index of the Frille "Verzeichnis der Getaufte, Getraute und Gestorbene,
1758-1804", which is the correct bride of Christian Fridrich Bleeke?

== Backgound and Evidence:
 
The xref:vol2-image202-53.adoc[marriage record] for Anne Margarethe Volkening and Christian Fridrich Bleeke shows they married on **22 February 1793**.
It states that the bride was

  aus Leteln (from Leteln)

We also know the birth of their first son, Carl Fridrich, occurred the following year, in 1794, and their next child, Johann Heinrich Philip, was born in
1797. Links to their birth records are below:

* xref:vol2-image123.adoc[Carl Fridrich Bleeke] baptized on 2^nd^ November 1794, likely born 30^th^ October
* xref:vol2-image136.adoc[Johann Heinrich Philipp Bleeke] baptized on 5^td^ November 1779, likely born 3^rd^ November

As adults these sons were the first of the Bleeke children to emigrate to the U.S. In December 1840, while residing in Hamiliton county, Ohio, each was 
awarded land patents by the U.S. Land Office in Fort Wayne to tracts of land in Union township, Adams, Indiana. Their younger brother Christian Fridrich
Bleeke, born 25 December 1800, would also immigrate to Adams county, Indiana.

.Kirchspiel defined
_Kirchspiel_ is the term that describes the _Ortschaften_, the surrounding villages, that belong to a particular nearby parish (Gemeinde).

=== Five Prospective Candidates

Approximately 70 Volkening births are listed in the birth index, and of these, three girls have *"Anne (Anna)** and the abbreviation of **Marg.** as given names.
Two have the adjacent pair of given names: "Anne Marg.":

==== Summary of Above Findings 

We note that Anne Catherine Ilse Margret Volkening, born 7 November 1764, tragically died in 1767. None of the other two baby girls was born **aus Leteln**, 
(from Leteln).

==== Summary of Final Two **Anne Marg.**'s

Only one of the two **Anne Marg. Volkenings** was from Leteln (aus Leteln). 

=== Summary of All Findings

None of the first three candidates were born in Leteln. Two of these were names **Anne tragically died about age three. Of the two remaining and youngest candidates, only Anne Margarethe
Volkening, age 22, was from **Leteln** as the marriage record xref:vol2-image202-53.adoc[marriage record] states for the bride's place of residence.

=== More Recent, Conclusive Findings

By examining the marriage entries (since there is no marriage index) in the range of probable marriage date for both Cathrine Ilse Margarethe Volkening aus Papinghausen and
Cathrine Engel Margreta Volkening, these marriage were found:

* The marriage of Anna Catherine Ilse Margaretha Volkening aus Papinghausen (from Papainghausen) to Christian Fridrich Bals aus Frille (from Frille), on
21 September 1788, is on <<image198, image 198, page 44 of the marriage pages, entry 4>>:

image::vol2-img198-44.jpg[titel="Marriage of Anna Catherine Ilse Margaretha Volkening(Click to enlarge)",xref=image$vol2-img198-44.jpg]

* The marriage of Anne Engel Marg. Volkening to Anthon Fridrich Bö[sc/h/uncertain], on 21 January 1787, is found on <<image197, image 197, page 43, entry 1>, is found on <<image197, image 197, page 43, entry 1>>.

image::vol2-img197-43.jpg[titel="Marriage of Anna Engel Margaretha Volkening(Click to enlarge)",xref=image$vol2-img197-43.jpg]

In 1794, the same year as the birth of Carl Fridrich Bleeke (son of Christian Friedrich and Anne Margaretha Volkening) a child was born to Anne Cath. Ilse Marg.
Volkening and Carl Friederich Bals. This birth is found on <<image121, image 121, page 225 of the births, entry 1>>:

image::vol2-img121-225.jpg[title="Birth in 1794 of a son of Anna Cath. Ilse. Marg. nee Volkening Bals (Click to englarge)",xref=image$vol2-img121-225.jpg]

We presently don't know the birth date of Christian Fridrich Bleeke. No Christian Fridrich Bleeke birth
is listed in the birth index for the years 1758 to 1804. Thus, either he was much older around age 35 (or older) and his birth is
recorded in the prior volume (which unfortunately has no indexes, requiring page-by-page examination), or his birth was recorded in a
different church's Kirchbuch.

If he was much older around age 35 or older, then we are forced to consider whether he might have married an older yet-undiscovered Anne
Margarethe whose birth is listed in the 1664-1757 Frille Kirchbuch. We have seen that of the first three candidates, one tragically died aournd age three, the other
two were not born in Leteln, and we have marriages for both (although the place of birth and residenece at time of marriage differ for Anna Engel Margarethe 
Volkening).

It is, though, more likely than not that Anne Margarethe Volkening, born 24 May 1770, is the correct bride. A certain conclusion depends on knowing more about the groom's age
But the wife of Christian Fridrich Bleeke was 22, which we take as the most likely age for a first marriage of the that time period.

We wish we hard, reliable, documented sources for individuals in Jürgen's link:https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/62546951/family?cfpid=32091459556[Bleeke Family Tree]
but we this analysis shows Anne Margerethe Volkening born is the prefered bride of Christian Fridrich Bleeke.
