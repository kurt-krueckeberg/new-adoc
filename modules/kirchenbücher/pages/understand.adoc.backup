== Marriage Banns or Proclamations

Marriage Banns or proclamations were announcements of an impending marriage between two individuals. Proclamtions are explained on link:https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Germany_-\_Marriage_-_1500-1874_Search_Strategy[FamilySearch's Germany - Marriage - 1500-1874 Search Strategy]

> Beginning about 1500, churches required their clergy to keep marriage records, which often included marriage banns or proclamations. Information
> found in the marriage banns depends on how detailed the minister made his record but usually includes the names of the bride and groom and the dates
> of the banns.

> ....If family register records do not exist, parish marriage banns are the best source for determining when a person was married.

== Brief Notes on Gothic Script

Chapter one of link:https://rpmgrtpublications.wixsite.com/mysite-2[Dechiphering Handingwriting in German Documents] discusses German gothic script in depth. It is indispensible.
For example, he mentions the gothic **R** and **K** -- pass:[<span style="font-family: '18th Century Kurrent Text'; font-size: 1.7em;">R</span>] and pass:[<span style="font-family: '18th Century Kurrent Text'; font-size: 2em;">K </span>] -- can be hard to distinguish, but
it is very uncommon for **R** to start a word.

=== Symbols and Abbreviations

 * The `+` symbol denotes a death date.
 * `Eod em` means _on the same day_ as the entry above.
 * The embellished Gothic `d` (ending in an elaborate descending inward loop) often appears immediately after the line number and preceding a date -- as in the entries in the _Marriage Entry 3_ figure <<image3, below>>. It means "den (the)".

=== Differences in Spelling 

In the image below, **todtgeboren Tochter** -- literally _dead-born daughter_ -- refers to a stillbirth. _todt_ in contemporary German there is no "t": _tod_. 

image::petzen:vol2-img68-line17.jpg[title="Birth entry from image 68", xref=image$vol2-img68-line17.jpg]

In entry 17 a stillbirth is denoted as: `17, Ein todtgeboren Tochter`.

=== Idiosyncracies of Petzen Scribes

In the Petzen church registers often the Kurrent "h" is perplexingly used for "s"; for example, in the spelling of `Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg` in his
xref:petzen$vol2-image5.adoc#jobst-heinrich-kruckeberg-1790[1790 marriage entry] as `Jobht Heinrich Krückeberg`.

=== Horizontal Line above a letter

The horizontal line written above a letter (most often consonants) means the letter should be doubled. The line above the **n** in `Waterman` below
means double the n: `Watermann`. In this case, it saved the scribe space as he encountered the right edge of the page.

.What sound does ÿ make?
****

[TIP]
.The sound of ÿ
====
On page 19 of   _Deciphering Handingwriting in German Documents_, Dr. Roger Minert explains ÿ is a vowel not a consonant:

 "Essentially non-existant as a consonant in German, this character has two main vowel
functions..."

.The two vowel sounds of ÿ
1. The sound of the dipthong `ei` or `ai` as in `Loreleÿ`.
2. When written after a consonant, it is pronounced as **ü** as in Sylke = pass:[<span style="font-family: '18th Century Kurrent Text'; font-size: 2em;">Sylke</span>] or as the "ee" sound in _Eggly_.

=== Understanding German Constant Clusters

There a several frequently occurring German consonant clusters that correspond to a single sound (phoneme). Below are examples:

* **sch**
** Scheumann: pass:[<pre style="font-family: '18th Century Kurrent Text'; font-size: 4em;">Scheumann</pre>]
** Gröschel: pass:[<pre style="font-family: '18th Century Kurrent Text'; font-size: 4em;">Gröschel</pre>]
** **Note:** When the "sch" was written with a quick hand, the "c" often got ommitted.
* **ch**
** Achem Seifert: pass:[<pre style="font-family: '18th Century Kurrent Text'; font-size: 4em;">Achem Seifert</pre>]
** Alois Albrecht: pass:[<pre style="font-family: '18th Century Kurrent Text'; font-size: 4em;">Alois Albrecht</pre>]
* **St** similiar to an **N** but with **t** intersecting the down stroke of the **N**:
** Stille: image:stille.jpg[]
* *tz*
** **jetzt**: note the extra final 't': pass:[<pre style="font-family: '18th Century Kurrent Text'; font-size: 4em;">jetzt</pre>]
* *pf*
** *pfeifen* -- to whistle: pass:[<pre style="font-family: '18th Century Kurrent Text'; font-size: 4em;">pfeifen</pre>]
