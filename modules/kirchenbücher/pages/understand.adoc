> Beginning about 1500, churches required their clergy to keep marriage records, which often included marriage banns or proclamations. Information
> found in the marriage banns depends on how detailed the minister made his record but usually includes the names of the bride and groom and the dates

> ....If family register records do not exist, parish marriage banns are the best source for determining when a person was married.

== Brief Notes on Gothic Script

Chapter one of link:https://rpmgrtpublications.wixsite.com/mysite-2[Dechiphering Handingwriting in German Documents] discusses German gothic script in depth. It is indispensible.
For example, he mentions the gothic **R** and **K** displayed below in their canonical form

pass:[<span style="font-family: 'Wiegel Kurrent Medium'; font-size: 1.7em;">R</span>] and pass:[<span style="font-family: 'Wiegel Kurrent Medium'; font-size: 2em;">K </span>]

can be hard to distinguish, but it is very uncommon for **R** to start a word.

=== Symbols and Abbreviations

 * The `+` symbol denotes a death date.
 * `Eod em` means _on the same day_ as the entry above.
 * The embellished Gothic `d` (ending in an elaborate descending inward loop) often appears immediately after the line number and preceding a date -- as in the entries in the _Marriage Entry 3_ figure <<image3, below>>. It means "den (the)".

=== Differences in Spelling 

In the image below, **todtgeboren Tochter** -- literally _dead-born daughter_ -- refers to a stillbirth. _todt_ in contemporary German there is no "t": _tod_.
